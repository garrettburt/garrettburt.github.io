# Introduction
*Due to the proprietary nature of my work these are examples of recent work completed*

Over the past couple of years, I have immersed myself in the world of R Shiny, using it extensively in my work, and it has become an indispensable part of my data toolkit. I have become an SME (Subject Matter Expert) in R Shiny at CVS Health and have conducted numerous trainings and mentorship opportunities in regards to helping others learn this skill.  As a technical expert in R Shiny, I have harnessed its power to create dynamic and interactive web applications that facilitate data driven decision making by many business partners. By leveraging R Shiny's capabilities, I have been able to bridge the gap between data analysis and business insights, offering stakeholders a user-friendly interface to explore complex analytical solutions in real-time. The versatility of R Shiny has allowed me to customize applications to meet specific needs, ensuring seamless communication of critical information across departments and enabling data-driven decisions that drive business growth. Its ability to rapidly iterate and adapt has significantly increased the efficiency of our team, empowering us to respond promptly to changing requirements and deliver solutions that are both insightful and practical. R Shiny has proven to be an invaluable asset in my professional journey, and I continue to explore new ways to harness its potential to unlock even greater value for our organization.

When it comes to specific examples of work using R Shiny, I'm prohibited from sharing specifics - but I wanted to utilize this space to talk through some generic approaches to how R Shiny can be used at scale in a large company. I have been the technical lead in developing 6 enterprise R Shiny applications over the past 3 years, which has given our business partners access to advanced analytics in a self-serve format.

When building R Shiny applications at scale, it is important to know how R Shiny works, what tools and frameworks are available, and some neat advanced R Shiny skills to make your application stand out and worth the investment over a pre-packaged data sharing tool (i.e Tableau, Power BI, etc.)

# Basics of R Shiny

### What is Shiny?
Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. You can host standalone apps on a webpage, embed them in R Markdown documents or build dashboards. You can also extend your Shiny apps with CSS themes, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript actions.  

### What are the components of an R Shiny Application?
An R Shiny application consists of several essential components that come together to create interactive and dynamic web-based data applications. The primary components include the user interface (UI) and the server logic. The user interface defines the layout and visual elements of the application, such as input controls, plots, tables, and text. It allows users to interact with the application and provides a seamless experience for data exploration. On the other hand, the server logic acts as the engine of the application, processing user inputs, performing data manipulations, and generating outputs based on the data analysis. The server logic is responsible for handling reactive expressions, which ensure that the application updates and responds to user actions in real-time. Additionally, Shiny applications can incorporate various user inputs, such as sliders, buttons, and text inputs, allowing users to customize the data analysis according to their preferences. Through these interconnected components, R Shiny empowers data professionals to create powerful and engaging data applications, fostering data-driven insights and enabling effective decision-making.

### shinydashboard
The shinydashboard package is a powerful extension of the R Shiny framework that revolutionizes the way we design and present interactive web applications. Unlike a basic R Shiny application, shinydashboard offers a user-friendly and customizable interface with a modern and professional look and feel. With shinydashboard, you can effortlessly create stunning dashboards enriched with sleek and intuitive layouts, including sidebar menus, tabsets, and navigation bars. This package seamlessly combines the power of R Shiny's interactivity with the elegance of a dashboard-style design, enabling users to efficiently explore and analyze complex data while maintaining an aesthetically pleasing user experience. By providing a wide range of pre-built components and layout templates, shinydashboard significantly reduces the development time, allowing data teams to focus on data analysis and insights rather than on the frontend design. With its ability to add widgets, charts, and visualizations effortlessly, shinydashboard empowers users to create impactful data dashboards that present information in a clear and engaging manner, making data-driven decision-making a seamless and enjoyable experience for end-users.

The shinydashboard package utilizes The Bootstrap grid approach to website design. The Bootstrap grid is a responsive, mobile-first layout system that provides a flexible and efficient way to structure website designs. It divides the webpage into rows and columns, allowing developers to create a consistent and visually appealing layout that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, enhancing the user experience across different devices.

# Scaling R Shiny Applications

As Shiny applications become more intricate and extensive, the need to manage their development and ensure scalability becomes increasingly crucial. This is where the Golem framework comes into play.
